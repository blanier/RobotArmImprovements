Make a cheap robotic arm cooler

I recently got one of [these off of Amazon] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017OFRCY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1):

and I want to make it cooler.  

For starters, the remote control is wired, and it really should be wireless.  Additionally, there's no feedback on position and/or travel limiters.  This project is my attempt to fix that.

I'm starting with the wireless control.  Then I'll move on to limit switches and then positional feedback.
